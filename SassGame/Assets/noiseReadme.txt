Heeey this is the readme for the noise branch
If you get console errors, you can either enter playmode
or do the following:

-select all the noiseWindows

-right click the generator component

-click 'generate perlin cave'

-You're done, the cave will generate in the editor

-No more errors


Best,
Arthur
